>> To compile a haskel file and execute
ghc -o sqRoot sqRoot.hs 
NOTE: it's important to write main = {...} 
In this one, we have the function defined and we call the function inside the haskell file only!

>> Else we can just simply define the function and load it
:load fileName
call the function with input

>> We can define it in terminal also!
Using let command
But now not necessary

>> MultiLine comment
{- This 
comment {- is a 
{-multiline-}-}-} 
NOTE: we shouldn't keep any space in the starting

>> For quitting
:quit

>> For rounding the value
decimal x = (fromIntegral ((round(x*100000))/100000) )

>> Indexing of list
numbers!!0 (we don't use [])
